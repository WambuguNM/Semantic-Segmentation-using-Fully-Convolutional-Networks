# Semantic Segmentation using Fully Convolutional Networks
In this project, we'll construct a fully convolutional neural network based on the VGGNet-16 architecture to perform semantic segmentation on a video captured from a front facing camera mounted on a vehicle dashboard to identify the drivable surface area. To achieve this task, we'll implement [Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jonlong/long_shelhamer_fcn.pdf), a paper published by Jonathan Long, Evan Shelhamer and Trevor Darrell from UC Berkeley that adapt contemporary classification network VGGNet into fully convolutional network and transfers its learned representations by fine-tuning to the segmentation task.
